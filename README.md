# Inspiration
Our team was determined to challenge a major problem of today's world which is working from home during Covid-19, and to create a practical solution for it. Since COVID-19 has caused a shift from working in an office to many working from home the need to set work boundaries is more essential than ever for people to feel less lonely, exhausted, unproductive, or even overwhelmed.
That’s why we dedicated our app to support the mental health of remote workers through these times. 

# What it does
Our platform allows users to keep track of their work hours, tasks, and schedule breaks throughout the day. Home Savvy provides breaks from one’s work routine that can easily be scheduled with a click of a button. This leaves workers feeling more happy, rested, productive and less likely to experience eye strain and burnout syndrome from overworking. Users can set breaks for just about anything. Whether that be “water cooler” breaks with your coworkers, petting your dog for 3 mins or even just a reminder to go eat lunch somewhere other than in front of your computer, Home Savvy encourages you to do things that will improve your mental health and make it easier for you to adjust.

# How we built it
We built it using Plain HTML/CSS and Javascript for frontend and Django for backend.

# Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to use and integrate these technologies was the biggest challenge. Since our team was not familiar with React using plain HTML/CSS and JavaScript was a little bit time-consuming. Some of the documentation was also hard to follow, and because of the libraries being a little unstable/buggy, we were facing a lot of new errors and problems.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of managing to create such an interesting, yet practical potential solution to such a pressing issue. Overcoming the errors and bugs with little resources, was frustrating at times, but was another good experience.

# What we learned
This hack made us learn:
Having a good mental health which is to take care of your body by eating right and exercising and at the same time be very productive is very important especially during Covid-19 for students as well as remote workers.
