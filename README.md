# Inspiration
Our team was determined to challenge a major problem of COVID-19, which is lack of productivity and declining mental health for workers due to the shift from working in an office to working from home. The need to set work boundaries is more essential than ever. Newly remote workers have a hard time adjusting and often feel lonely, exhausted, unproductive and overwhelmed. That’s why we dedicated our app to support the mental health of remote workers through these times. We believe that being productive does not mean sitting at your desk for 8 hours straight. Everybody should take breaks as it is proven to increase productivity and improve mental and physical health. Our app aims to remind people of this. 

# What it does
Our platform allows users to keep track of their work hours, tasks, and schedule reminders to take breaks throughout the day. Home Savvy provides breaks from one's work routine that can easily be scheduled with a click of a button. Users can set breaks for just about anything. Whether that be virtual “water cooler” breaks with your coworkers, petting your dog for 3 minutes or even just a reminder to go eat lunch somewhere other than in front of your computer, Home Savvy encourages you to do things that will improve your mental health and make it easier for you to adjust. 

# How we built it
We built it using plain HTML/CSS and Javascript.

# Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to use and integrate these technologies was the biggest challenge. Since our team was not familiar with React using plain HTML/CSS and JavaScript was a little bit time-consuming. Some of the documentation was also hard to follow, and because of the libraries being a little unstable/buggy, we faced a lot of errors and problems.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of creating a practical potential solution to such a pressing issue. In terms of code, overcoming and handling the errors and bugs with little resources, was frustrating at times, but was another good learning experience.

# What we learned
This hack made us learn:
Maintaining and improving one's mental health is directly correlated to being productive. People should do what they need to do to take care of themselves. Similarily, we applied this concept to our time at this hackathon. We took breaks when needed which ultimately allowed us to be more productive and almost finish our prototype.
